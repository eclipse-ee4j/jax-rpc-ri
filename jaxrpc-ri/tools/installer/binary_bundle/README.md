To update your installation of JWSDP, first back up your existing
[jwsdp-home]/jaxrpc/lib/jaxrpc-impl.jar file where [jwsdp-home] is the
directory containing the JWSDP. Either copy the file to another location
or change the name so that it no longer ends in ".jar". Then copy the
jaxrpc-impl.jar file from the [jaxrpc-home]/lib directory to the
[jwsdp-home]/jaxrpc/lib directory where [jaxrpc-home] is the directory
where you installed this patch.
